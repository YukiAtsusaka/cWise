\description{
Typical, artificially generated toy data set that comes with the binary response in the crosswise question (Y=1 if TRUE-TRUE or FALSE-FALSE, Y=0 otherwise),
the binary response in the anchor question, two covariates, and auxiliary probabilities in the crosswise and anchor questions, respectively (these columns are only included here for an illustrative purpose).
