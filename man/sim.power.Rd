\title{Compute Statistical Power for a Fixed Sample Size}
\usage{
sim.power(N.sim, sample, pi.null, pi.alt, p, p.prime, gamma, direct)
}
\arguments{
\item{N.sim}{Integer. Number of Monte Carlo simulations.
Larger values provide more stable power estimates but increase computation time.}

\item{sample}{Integer. The fixed sample size (number of respondents) to evaluate.}

\item{pi.null}{Numeric. Prevalence rate under the null hypothesis (π0).
Can be 0 or a value from direct questioning.}

\item{pi.alt}{Numeric. True prevalence rate under the alternative hypothesis (π1).
Must be greater than pi.null.}

\item{p}{Numeric. Probability for the randomization item in the sensitive question.
Values between 0.1 and 0.3 are typical.}

\item{p.prime}{Numeric. Probability for the anchor question (non-sensitive).}

\item{gamma}{Numeric. Proportion of attentive respondents (between 0 and 1).
For example, 0.8 means 80\% of respondents are attentive.}

\item{direct}{Numeric. Direct questioning estimate for comparison purposes.}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar representing the estimated statistical power
(probability of correctly rejecting H0 when H1 is true) at the given sample size.
}
\description{
Computes statistical power for a one-sided hypothesis test of
H0: π ≤ π0 vs H1: π > π0 at a given fixed sample size. This is useful
when researchers already know their sample size and want to assess the
power they can expect from their study.
}
\details{
The function implements the power calculation based on the Wald test:
\deqn{Power = \Phi\left(\frac{\pi_1 - \pi_0 + z_\alpha \tilde{\sigma}_0}{\tilde{\sigma}_1}\right)}
where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\Phi} is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal
  \item \eqn{z_\alpha} is derived from the simulated null distribution
  \item \eqn{\tilde{\sigma}_0} and \eqn{\tilde{\sigma}_1} are simulated standard errors
        under H0 and H1 respectively
}

The function runs \code{sim.cwdata()} twice — once under H0 using \code{pi.null}
and once under H1 using \code{pi.alt} — to estimate the sampling distributions
at the specified sample size.
}
\note{
This function can take considerable time to run depending on N.sim and
sample size. For quick exploration, use smaller N.sim values (e.g., 100-500).
For publication-quality results, use N.sim >= 2000.
