\description{
Typical, artificially generated toy data set that comes with the binary response in the crosswise question (Y=1 if TRUE-TRUE or FALSE-FALSE, Y=0 otherwise),
the binary response in the anchor question, the outcome variable, two covariates, and auxiliary probabilities in the crosswise and anchor questions, respectively (these columns are only included here for an illustrative purpose).
